## TikTok LIVE Music: Enhancing Music Communities & Artist Discovery Through In-App Experiences

### Problem Statement & Solution
When we look at TikTok’s current state of music discovery, there is a general concern that artists who go viral on TikTok will be unable to obtain a consistent audience, ultimately becoming known as one-hit wonders. Our team, The Jams, propose implementing a new listening party feature that builds on top of TikTok’s current LIVE infrastructure. TikTok LIVE Music, an in-app experience for music discovery and artist-fan community building will bridge the gap between fans and artists by providing a space to explore discography, new and old, in a fresh engaging way. Our website demos particular aspects of this new feature including the Artist-Hosted Listening Party and Collaborative Song Playlist.

### Artist-Hosted Listening Party
From the user’s perspective, there are many ways to get involved in a Listening Party. By default, users are presented with a main screen containing the current song’s title, cover, and a few lines of the lyrics. Clicking on the lyrics within our website interactive demo will open a separate screen with the complete lyrics. At the bottom of the main screen, users can take advantage of the live chat to send messages to the artist as well as chat with other listeners. 

### Collaborative Playlist
We recognize fans may want to participate in choosing songs to play so we implemented a collaborative playlist with a design intentionally similar to the Gift system in Tiktok’s LIVE feature. In our website demo, users are presented with an overlay showcasing clickable icons. Each icon, also known as a Boost, includes a single song available in the playlist along with a price in both Coins and Tokens. When the Boosts are tapped and purchased, users will be able to push the respective song forward in the playlist.
